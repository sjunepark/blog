## Why Cloudflare?

Cloudflare is a great platform for deploying static sites. It comes with a lot of built-in features related to
performance, security, image optimization, etc. But for lots of developers, it is great that it has a very generous free
tier, and its pricing model is usage based even if you go beyond the free tier.

Also, the Cloudflare specific concepts and environments (such as Workers, Bindings, etc.) can be a bit confusing at
first, but they can be not only very useful but also increase DX a lot once you understand them.

## Astro rendering modes

The [Astro official docs](https://docs.astro.build/en/basics/rendering-modes/) has a great explanation, and it breaks
down rendering modes into two categories: 1. Pre-rendered and 2. On-demand rendered.

However, I find it much easier to create a mental model by breaking it down into three as below:

### 1. Pre-rendered pages

**By default, Astro pre-renders all the pages at build time**, meaning that page renders only happen during the initial
build. And all the pre-rendered pages will be served as simple files(html, css, js) without any processing during user
requests.

Also, by default, no javascript is executed on the client side. All the javascript logic will run during build time
unless you use the [`client:` directive](https://docs.astro.build/en/reference/directives-reference/#client-directives).

### 2. On-demand rendered pages

Pre-rendering is the default behavior, but you can opt out of this behavior as you wish for specific pages or
routes[^1].
This is called on-demand rendering, meaning that the page will be rendered at the point of time when the user requests.

[^1]:
You can opt out of pre-rendering behavior by specifying `output: 'hybrid'` in the astro config file
with `export const prerender = false;` for individual pages, or setting `output: 'server'`.
Refer to the [docs](https://docs.astro.build/en/guides/server-side-rendering/#enable-on-demand-server-rendering).

### 3. On-demand rendered API endpoints

If you place `.ts` or `.js` within the `pages` directory, they will be treated as API endpoints.
Refer to the [docs](https://docs.astro.build/en/recipes/call-endpoints/) for additional details.

_Now that we understand how Astro renders pages, let's learn how Cloudflare deploys Astro apps._

## Astro With Cloudflare

### Cloudflare Pages vs Cloudflare Workers

_Before we apply Astro, let's understand how Cloudflare deploys websites in general._

When deploying sites to Cloudflare, you can use [Cloudflare Pages](https://developers.cloudflare.com/pages/)
and [Cloudflare Workers](https://developers.cloudflare.com/Workers/).

**Cloudflare Pages** are for serving static sites by default, meaning that you don't have control of a traditional
server which can respond to user requests.
Cloudflare just stores your build output(the static site), and distributes it via its CDN.
On user requests, Cloudflare simply just passes the stored static files to the user.

If you need dynamic server (for 2. On-demand rendered pages and 3. On-demand rendered API endpoints), you have to use
**Cloudflare Workers**.
Put simple, Cloudflare Workers are serverless execution environments distributed on the edge that allow you to create
and serverless functions.

The relieving part is that you don't have to write any Cloudflare Worker functions manually.
Adapters like [@astrojs/cloudflare](https://docs.astro.build/en/guides/integrations-guide/cloudflare/) automatically
gathers routes(or pages) that need on-demand rendering, and puts them in a Cloudflare Worker function.
All you have to do is write your Astro app,
and the adapter will convert it to appropriate Cloudflare Worker scripts automatically.

### How Cloudflare handles Astro

It's intuitive that '1.
Pre-rendered pages' will be served by Cloudflare Pages, and '2.
On-demand rendered pages' and '3. On-demand rendered API endpoints' will be served by Cloudflare Workers.

_Table: How each rendering mode responds to requests_

| Rendering Mode        | When user request is received                | By         |
|-----------------------|----------------------------------------------|------------|
| 1. Pre-rendered pages | Pre-built files are provided via CDN         | CF Pages   |
| 2. On-demand pages    | Page is built/rendered on-demand and served  | CF Workers |
| 3. On-demand API      | Process request and respond for each request | CF Workers |

> Now that we understand how Cloudflare handles an Astro app, let's see how environment variables are injected and used
> in each environment.

## Environment Variables

### Environment variables in Vite

There are various ways to access environment variables.
In a node environment, you would use `process.env`[^2].
But in Vite (which Astro uses for its build process) you can use `import.meta.env'`to access not only Vite [built-in
environment variables](https://vitejs.dev/guide/env-and-mode#env-variables), but also custom environment variables you
would store in `.env`.

[^2]:
You can use `process.env` according to
the [vite docs](https://vitejs.dev/config/#using-environment-variables-in-config),
but as you import `dotenv`, the Cloudflare adapter will through errors during build.
I'm not sure what the reason or the internals are for this,
and I haven't faced a reason to use `process.env` over `import.meta.env` in a Vite app.

### Environment variables in Cloudflare Workers

However, Vite only takes part in the application build process.
Cloudflare Worker has its own runtime environment,
and you have to use its [runtime api](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/runtime-apis/).

The Astro docs explain how to use
the [Cloudflare runtime](https://docs.astro.build/en/guides/integrations-guide/cloudflare/#cloudflare-runtime).
You can use `wrangler.toml`
or `.dev.vars` to **store** environment variables in the local/development environment,
and **access** them through the `context` parameter in the endpoint api function as below.

```ts
import {APIRoute} from "@astrojs/cloudflare";

// [!code word:context:1]
export const GET: APIRoute = async (context) => {
    const myEnvVar = context.locals.runtime.env.MY_ENV_VAR;
    console.log(myEnvVar);
    return new Response("Some body");
};
```

> 💭 You can create a mental model by thinking that Cloudflare is **injecting** relevant information as arguments to
> the functions

### `import.meta.env`vs `context.locals.runtime.env`

So, when should you use which? The results are as below.

_Table: Environment variables' availability in each environment_

| Variables                      | `astro dev` | wrangler preview | `astro build` | CF Worker |
|--------------------------------|:-----------:|:----------------:|:-------------:|:---------:|
| `import.meta.env`<br/>built-in |      ✅      |        ✅         |       ✅       |     ✅     |
| `import.meta.env`<br/>custom   |      ✅      |        ✅         |       ✅       |     ❌     |
| `context.locals.runtime.env`   |      ❌      |        ✅         |       ❌       |     ✅     |

- `astro dev` is the local development environment which you'd probably use the most during development.
- **wrangler preview** represents the local preview environment of Cloudflare, when you
  run `wrangler pages dev ./dist`.
  (See the [docs](https://docs.astro.build/en/guides/deploy/cloudflare/#enabling-preview-locally-with-wrangler))
- `astro build` is the build process, regardless of whether you run it locally or during the Cloudflare Pages build
  process.
    - ⭐️ You can think of this as the step where your **pre-rendered pages** will be built.
- **CF Worker** represents the actual Cloudflare Worker runtime in production
    - ⭐️ This is where your **on-demand rendered pages** and **on-demand API endpoints** will run.

_(For a simple reproducible project,
clone this [repo](https://github.com/sjunepark/understanding-astro-cloudflare-environments) and play around)_

### Conclusion

As you can see, the **built-in** environment variables of `import.meta.env`,
such as `MODE`, `DEV`, `PROD`, etc., can be accessed in **all cases**.

⭐️ However, when you want to access your **custom environment variables**,
you have to use `import.meta.env` for the pre-rendered pages, and `context.locals.runtime.env` for the on-demand
rendered pages and API endpoints.
This is a very confusing behavior[^3] but crucial to understand.

[^3]:
It's hard to understand why you can't access the custom environment variables through `import.meta.env` in
Cloudflare workers,
since the environment variables will be replaced with the corresponding string values during the build process.
(You can find the relevant source code in `dist/_worker.js`)
Since the built output `_worker.js` will be deployed to Cloudflare Workers,
I expect that environment variables will be accessible through `import.meta.env`, but they're not.

## Real-world Application

### Naive approach

You can use the `context` parameter for every endpoint function,
but I find it very cumbersome since I'd have to use code like below for every endpoint.

```ts
import {APIRoute} from "@astrojs/cloudflare";

export const GET: APIRoute = async (context) => {
    let connectionString: string;
    if (import.meta.env.DEV) {
        // Get from `.env` during `astro dev`
        connectionString = import.meta.env.DEV_CONNECTION_STRING;
    } else {
        // use the context object during Cloudflare Worker runtime
        connectionString = context.locals.runtime.env.CONNECTION_STRING;
    }
    // ...
};
```

### Solution: Use middleware

You can create a utility function that takes in a `context` object and returns the relevant environment variables,
and use that function for every endpoint function.

However,
I think using [middleware](https://docs.astro.build/en/guides/middleware/) is a more stable and scalable approach.
By using middleware, you can save proper environment variables to the `context.locals` object,
so that any api endpoint function can access them without any additional logic.
([Astro docs:
Storing data in `context.locals`](https://docs.astro.build/en/guides/middleware/#storing-data-in-contextlocals))

Here's an example.

```ts
import {defineMiddleware} from "astro/middleware";

export const onRequest = defineMiddleware(({locals}, next) => {
    const runtime = locals.runtime;

    locals.DB_URL = import.meta.env.DEV
        ? import.meta.env.DEV_DB_URL
        : runtime?.env.DB_URL || import.meta.env.DB_URL;

    locals.DB_AUTH_TOKEN = import.meta.env.DEV
        ? undefined
        : runtime?.env.DB_AUTH_TOKEN || import.meta.env.DB_AUTH_TOKEN;
    return next();
});
```

## Summary

As a novice, it was hard to understand the Cloudflare environment and the context ad proper use of environment
variables.
Hope this post can be helpful for some with similar struggles.
Thanks for reading!
